Your friend comes to your place with his USB flash drive to copy some software/photos/pr0n/whatever. Well, he's not actually your friend, you only let him think so. And then you notice THAT folder on his USB drive. The one you want to get your hands on badly. But he's right there, and like hell he'll let you copy it.

That's where shinobi comes into play. You press Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Whatever, and the folder you want so badly is silently copied to your hard drive. You win.
